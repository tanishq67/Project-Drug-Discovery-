Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens, which is core reason why breast cancer happens. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can eliminate the production of estrogen.

In this project I gathered the data, preprocessed, performed exploratary data analysis on them and then build machine learning models and compared them in order to make predicition as well as to obtain data driven insights that will be useful for the discovery of a drug that may inhibit Aromatase.
I also deployed my selected model as a web application.

Basic, overview how I did it.
- I first collected the Data from the ChEMBL Database and then Pre-Processed it.

- Then I performed Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis.

- I calculated molecular descriptors that are essentially quantitative description of the compounds in the dataset. And then I prepared this into a dataset for machine learning models.

- Then I build a regression model of Aromatase inhibitors using the random forest algorithm.

- I then compared ML algorithms for build regression models of Aromatase inhibitors.
